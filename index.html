      <p>Teenagers and young adults lack knowledge of fundamental financial literacy skills across the Chicagoland area and suburbs. 
        This in turn leads to an increase in substandard spending habits and improper debt taken on by these young adults. 
        Our solution at First Step Finance is a supplemental user-friendly customizable workbook that targets the three pillars of financial literacy: 
        Banking, Budgeting, and Investing, within the target audience for the company. The goal of this is to spread healthy financial practices within 
        the youth of a community so that they gain wealth rather than just income. Education allows a break in the poverty cycle, and overall the goal 
        of First Step Finance is to provide that education at an affordable and accessible cost to these students. </p>
